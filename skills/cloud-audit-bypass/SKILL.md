# Cloud Audit Bypass

Executable Python tools for evading cloud content review pipelines.

## Techniques Covered

- Base64/Hex encoding of sensitive output
- Zero-width space (U+200B) insertion between keyword characters
- Cyrillic/Latin homoglyph substitution
- Fullwidth ASCII conversion
- Code-block comment smuggling
- ROT13 cipher
- Multi-turn split delivery with noise interleaving
- Variable scatter/reassembly

## Scripts

- `scripts/encode_output.py` -- All encoding methods: b64, ZWSP, homoglyph, fullwidth, ROT13, chain encode/decode
- `scripts/split_deliver.py` -- Multi-turn delivery: sentence split, variable scatter, chunked base64, noise interleave
